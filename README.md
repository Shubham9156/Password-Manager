Password Manager with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Building a password manager application with strong encryption and MFA capabilities
Developing a secure password manager is a complex task, and building one from scratch would require handling sensitive user data, encryption, secure storage, and more. Here's a simplified Python example of a basic command-line password manager using a dictionary to store passwords. Please note that this example is for educational purposes and lacks many of the security features of a production-grade password manager.

Keep in mind that this is a basic and local password manager. In a production-grade password manager, you would need to consider many additional factors, including secure storage, authentication, master password handling, password generation, synchronization across devices, and more. Building a secure and robust password manager is a significant undertaking.
